## Did you know? You can hire me!

I grew infrastructures from a handful engineers and thousands of users to platforms with hundreds of millions of users and dozens of teams, each with dozens of engineers. This taught me valuable lessons about building, operating and scaling infrastructure.

While one size does not fit all, doing things right the first time will not only save time refactoring. A good infrastructure is a resilient foundation for your service that supports the agility you need early on without much ramp up costs. A bad infrastructure not only requires manual operation but also slows down every single engineer, preventing them from being confident in changes, which leads to accumulation of technical debt and can end in a grid lock across engineering.

I've seen them all. The good, the bad and the outright ugly. Enterprise and startup. And I've built, fixed and deployed technology like [Docker](/tag/docker/), [Kubernetes](/2016/11/20/15-producation-grade-kubernetes-cluster/) and [Prometheus](/2015/01/26/monitor-docker-containers-with-prometheus/) to address those issues. I know [what to buy and what to build](/2015/04/22/scope-and-ownership-in-tech-companies/) and patterns to [manage complexity](http://5pi.de/2015/08/31/dont-manage-config-unless-you-have-to/).

Now I want to help you with your infrastructure!

## Inquiry
Building something new and want to avoid the common and not-so-common pitfalls?
Your developers can't iterate quickly, you miss deadlines and need help figuring out how to fix that?
Do you need help with your Kubernetes cluster, Prometheus monitoring or bare metal infrastructure automation?

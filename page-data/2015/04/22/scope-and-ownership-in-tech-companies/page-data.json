You don’t build your own servers, let alone CPUs and chances are high, you don’t even run servers on your own.\nAll this is fine. It’s not your business to build CPUs, so you shouldn’t. Same for managing datacenters and servers. If it’s not your core business, you probably won’t ever be as good at it as someone specialized in it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, never outsource what makes up your company. You can’t have someone else build something crucial and tightly related to your companies overall business. If you don’t do your own Community Management, Support or PR, people will realize that your company and brand has nothing to do with your social media presence.\nOutsourcing this is like outsourcing your face.</p>\n<p>If your product needs custom software, you should build it. It still seems like a lot of companies believe software can be bought in like car service parts without realizing software is never done. It’s not even ever bug free, so it needs constant attention by people who feel part of the company and see purpose in what they are doing.</p>\n<p>Software is also usually the interface with your customers and you don’t want something you don’t <em>own</em> between you and your customers. Not only that you don’t understand and can’t control, but all feedback loops are much wider. You listen to your customers, explain your ideas to some agency, they explain it to their developers and after some time you get a result. For every problem with that piece of software, you need to go through the whole loop again. Every competitor doing this in-house will move <em>much</em> faster due to their short feedback loops. You see a problem, you fix it.</p>\n<p>Even internally, think about what makes up your company and how much of the internal infrastructure and software you want to own. If you are a small web shop, you’re good to <em>use</em> existing frameworks and services. You can usually expect them to work for your use cases. If not, you need to fill tickets and wait for someone to fix them.\nNow if you are company operating at large scale, you need to actually <em>own</em> those services since you will run into issues nobody else ran into. In our open source world, this doesn’t necessary mean to write your own software but have people to <em>own</em> those components, people able to understand their internals and able to fix bugs without any vendor supporting them. You see a problem you fix it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-your-teams-should-do\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-your-teams-should-do\" aria-label=\"what your teams should do permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What your teams should do</h1>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ce4c6510a30130413060085014fcb3b3/b8220/samurai.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 79.14110429447852%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Team\"\n        title=\"Team\"\n        src=\"/static/ce4c6510a30130413060085014fcb3b3/6aca1/samurai.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ce4c6510a30130413060085014fcb3b3/d2f63/samurai.jpg 163w,\n/static/ce4c6510a30130413060085014fcb3b3/c989d/samurai.jpg 325w,\n/static/ce4c6510a30130413060085014fcb3b3/6aca1/samurai.jpg 650w,\n/static/ce4c6510a30130413060085014fcb3b3/b8220/samurai.jpg 733w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\nNo matter how you build teams or how you call them, I believe they should be as independent from each other as possible while providing benefits to all other teams where possible.\nAs too many cooks spoil the broth, having many engineers working on the same code base usually isn’t working. You run into all kind of problems, from merge conflicts to bikeshedding and unclear escalation paths.</p>\n<p>The probably best way to avoid this is by splitting your monolithic application into (micro)services. Each teams develops their service independently. Since services depend on each other, you need to make your APIs backward compatible or introduce some kind of versioning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-build-it-you-run-it\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-build-it-you-run-it\" aria-label=\"you build it you run it permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You build it, you run it</h2>\n<p>Each team does not only develop their own service, they also deploy, operate and monitor it. You will never fully understand how an application behaves if you don’t run it on your own. With the right monitoring in place, it’s usually not that hard to isolate in which service’s domain a problem occurred. This guarantees short feedback loops and sets the right incentives to balance features and work on technical debt.\nThis also implies that there is <em>no ops team</em>. Ops isn’t a team, it’s a role, something everyone should be doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"self-service\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#self-service\" aria-label=\"self service permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Self-service</h2>\n<p>The teams being able to own each aspect of their service requires a self-service infrastructure.\nIt depends on how similar the requirements of different teams are and how much operational experience they have.\nIf you’re running on AWS, you might just give every team their own login and ability to spin up machines and resources as they need. But this requires quite some operational experience to make this secure and reliable and there will be lot of pieces that every team needs to re-invent.\nTherefore, the self-service platform should address all needs that are similar across all your services and support. It might look like Heroku or Elastic Beanstalk but might be more opinionated and specific to your company.\nThose infrastructure services are the same as user facing services. Some team builds and operates them, it’s simply a service for which customers are other engineers within your company.\nThis isn’t Ops and it’s not DevOps either, although due to the nature of the service it might involve more systems knowledge than frontend development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scaling-beyond-that\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#scaling-beyond-that\" aria-label=\"scaling beyond that permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Scaling beyond that</h2>\n<p>At large scale funny things happen and in a large company, you want people specialized in those problem.

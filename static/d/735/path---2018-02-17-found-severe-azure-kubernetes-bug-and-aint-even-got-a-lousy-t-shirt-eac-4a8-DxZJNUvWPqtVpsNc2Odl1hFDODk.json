And it\nworked.</p>\n<p>First I though I made some mistake setting up the storage account or Kubernetes\nitself, but I quickly realized that all of the dozens of VHD urls I found in\nvarious github issues could be downloaded without any authentication!</p>\n<p><strong>Turns out, all Volume Claims that were created on Azure between 1.6.0 and 1.6.5\nwere world readable.</strong></p>\n<p>I reported the issue by following the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/security/\">Kubernetes Security and\nDisclosure</a> guidelines. While the team was\nresponsive in general and the problem fixed quickly, I wasn’t very happy with\nhow the announcement was handled. It felt like it was kept under the radar and I\nnever got credited, let alone qualified for a bug bounty.</p>\n<p>Of course I’d love to get credited and get a bug bounty but I’m more\nworried about what this handling means for the next person considering to\nresponsibly disclose similar issue.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes is my bread and butter right now and I have high expectations towards\nit. I’ve contributed to several components and I have high regards for the\nmaintainers of the project and the companies involved. I too had the impression\nthat Microsoft changed and takes these things serious these days, so I was\nsurprised how this was handled. I also was quite disappointed by not getting any\nresponse anymore around why this didn’t qualify for a bug bounty.</p>\n<p>I’ll continue to disclose issues responsibly but I fully understand people who\ndon’t want to jump through these hoops if they don’t even get credited for it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timeline\"><a href=\"#timeline\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<h4 id=\"2017-06-15\"><a href=\"#2017-06-15\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>2017-06-15</h4>\n<p>Initial Report and first response with promising to send a\nfollow up later that day.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2017-06-17\"><a href=\"#2017-06-17\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>2017-06-17</h4>\n<p>The issue was fixed in Kubernetes:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47605\">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47605</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"2017-06-19\"><a href=\"#2017-06-19\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>2017-06-19</h4>\n<p>After not hearing back, I asked again about a CVE and the plans\nto announce the issue. I’ve got a response the same day, confirming that a CVE\nwill be issues and that they’re still working on identifying the affected\ncustomers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2017-07-07\"><a href=\"#2017-07-07\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>2017-07-07</h4>\n<p>So far, no CVE was issues so I asked again. I also asked if they\nare okay with me blogging about it.</p>\n<p>In the response I was told that CVE was requested but not yet issued. I was also\nasked to please not talk about this issue publically until they finished letting\naffected customers know.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2017-07-13\"><a href=\"#2017-07-13\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>2017-07-13</h4>\n<p>I’ve got an update, letting me know that the security team is in their final\nstages.

I was pointed to <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kubernetes-security-announce/n3VBg_WJZic/-ddIqKXqAAAJ\">a post in\nkubernetes-security-announce</a>\nwhich I never heard about before (it only includes three posts).

Apparently though this is all\nthe announcemnts that will be done in such situation.</p>\n<p>I’ve also ask specifically if this qualifies for some of Microsoft’s bug\nbounties.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2017-09-19\"><a href=\"#2017-09-19\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"></a>2017-09-19</h4>\n<p>I’ve asked again about a bounty.

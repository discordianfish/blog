I'm a lazy person who never took time to organize their photos so I got really excited about Google Photos and just finished uploading all my Photos to it. I used flickr in the past but just dumping photos there, even if I can search for EXIF tag data doesn't make much difference to storing them on a hard disk in a drawer.

Google Photo on the other hand *understands* what's going on in a picture.
Google uses a [neural network](https://medium.com/backchannel/how-google-s-new-photos-app-can-tell-cats-from-dogs-ffd651dfcd80) which is trained by millions of photos on the web to identify objects in pictures.

This works very well and when thinking about it's mistakes, the uncanny feeling just amplifies: They are mistakes, they aren't bugs. It's not faulty, it's just a little unexperienced - almost like a child.
In fact, I would be very interested in a catogorization standoff between a child and Google.

Let's finish this course with a nice bowl of raw chicken.

To be fair, you could consider [british shorthair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Shorthair) the dogs of cats.

Birds. That's definitely correct.

Bar graph or 8-bit skylines?

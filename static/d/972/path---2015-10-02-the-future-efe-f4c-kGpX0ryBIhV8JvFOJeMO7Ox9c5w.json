It was close to impossible, yet he succeeded.</p>\n<p>From todays perspective, this seems like a nobrainer. I found myself recently\nthinking: “Boohh, cars for individual transportation is to 1900”. Soon, you\nwon’t buy cars anymore. (Sure, that’s something Tesla knows as well and they are\nstill in a good position).</p>\n<p>Beside being incrediably fascinating, this velocity has another advantage: You\ncan think crazy sci-fi and see just a few years later how close you got. So I\nthought I start blogging about a few crazy ideas. Maybe someone even finds\nthemself inspired by those.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Future","date":"October 02, 2015","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015/10/02/the-future/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015/09/02/uploaded-thousands-of-photos-to-google-photos-here-are-the-best-classification-mistakes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Uploaded thousands of Photos to Google Photos, here are the best classification mistakes"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015/10/05/the-future-fabrication-cloud/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Future: Fabrication Cloud"}}}}
